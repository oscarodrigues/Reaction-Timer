# Reaction-Timer

In this project, I:

• Designed a reaction-timer using VHDL.

• Used Quartus to synthesize and ModelSim to simulate implementation.

To run the program, download the entire folder and extract it into the one working directory. Next, start up Quartus and open reactiontimer.qpf. Here, you can synthesize the program and change the pins to your liking. It is currently set up for the Terasic DE10 Lite board. The repository contains an image displaying a timing diagram of the working product. The ModelSim simulation files can be found under workingdirectory/simulation/modelsim.

If you have any more questions, feel free to message me!
